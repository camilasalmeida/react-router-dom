This application demonstrates the use of React Router in a React-based single-page application (SPA). It simulates a simple Pokémon database where users can view a list of Pokémon, see details about a specific Pokémon, and add new Pokémon to the list. React Router is used to handle client-side navigation, making the app feel more like a multi-page application while maintaining the SPA architecture.

## Features
- **React Router**: Handles navigation between pages (`/pokemon`, `/pokemon/:pokemonId`, `/pokemon/new`).
- **Dynamic Routing**: We use dynamic routing for displaying Pokémon details. For example, the route `/pokemon/:pokemonId` uses a dynamic segment `:pokemonId` to load the appropriate Pokémon details based on the ID provided.
- **Form Handling**: Allows users to add new Pokémon to the list using a form.
- **Programmatic Navigation**: The app demonstrates how to programmatically navigate to different routes after certain actions, such as redirecting after submitting a form to add a new Pokémon.
